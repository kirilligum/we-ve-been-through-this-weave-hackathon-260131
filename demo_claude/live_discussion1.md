User: CI is red again; test_event_dedupe_idempotent fails; run ci-19702 has logs.
Claude: I'll help you investigate the failing test—let me check the CI logs from run ci-19702 to see what's causing `test_event_dedupe_idempotent` to fail.

Could you provide either the CI log link or more details about what the test failure shows? That will help me pinpoint the issue quickly.
