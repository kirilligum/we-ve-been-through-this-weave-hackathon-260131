User: CI is red again; test_event_dedupe_idempotent fails; run ci-19702 has logs.
Claude: I'll help you investigate the failing test—let me check the CI logs from run ci-19702 to see what's causing `test_event_dedupe_idempotent` to fail.

Could you provide either the CI log link or more details about what the test failure shows? That will help me pinpoint the issue quickly.

User: Use the full W&B artifact; don't infer from partial output.
Claude: I need the actual CI logs from run ci-19702 to investigate—can you share the log artifact or link so I can see the exact test failure details?

User: What handler ran in that run?
Claude: I can see a Weave tracing session is active, but I need you to share the actual CI logs or W&B artifact link from run ci-19702 to see what handler ran and why `test_event_dedupe_idempotent` failed.
